## Papagenome: A Utility Tool for Pan-Genome Analysis Using Docker

Papagenome is a utility tool designed to simplify the analysis of pan-genomes by acting as a wrapper for commonly used tools, leveraging Docker for seamless execution.

### Requirements

To use Papagenome, you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.  
Additionally, Docker must be running (i.e., the Docker daemon must be active).  
To verify if Docker is running, use the following command:

```bash
docker info
```

- If Docker is running, you will see detailed information about your Docker configuration.
- If it is not running, you will see an error message indicating that the Docker daemon is not active.

### Supported Platforms

Papagenome is available for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**.

You can download the appropriate version for your operating system from the **Releases** section.

### Running the Tool

We recommend using the `.jar` file if you already have **Java 21 or higher** installed on your system.  
You can download the latest JDK from the official website:  
[https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html)

Alternatively, you can use the installer provided for your operating system.
